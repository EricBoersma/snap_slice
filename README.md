This is abandonware. The original purpose of this repository was simply to do some learning with 
Tensorflow to get an introduction to using machine learning to do image analysis. When that went well,
I started using it for doing so on video. Unfortunately, the subject that I chose (recognizing parts of a football broadcast)
meant doing more full-image pattern matching than working on individual parts of a video. Also, it's likely
that my usage here is inefficient, as this is the first project I ever undertook using
Tensorflow. The result is that this code can process video at about 3 frames per second,
or approximately 1/8th to 1/10th as fast as just watching the video. 

So, if you find this code, or the training files to be useful, please feel free to use them. 
They're effective, and can recognize the different parts of a football broadcast with
about 97% accuracy.
